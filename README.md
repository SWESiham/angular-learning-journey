# Angular Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning Angular and frontend development.  
Although I haven't started using Angular yet, I'm building the foundational parts of the project using **HTML** and **CSS** to design and prototype user interfaces.

## 💬 Quote for Motivation

> “You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.”  
> — Martin Luther King Jr.

## 🧰 Current Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3  
- No frameworks or JavaScript used (yet)

## 📁 Project Structure

Each task is organized in a separate folder for clarity. For now, each folder contains basic `index.html` and `style.css` files for UI structure and design.

## 🖥️ How to Run

You can view any of the tasks by simply:

1. Navigating to the desired folder (e.g., `task-01`).
2. Opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

> 💡 You don’t need any server or frameworks at this stage.

## 📌 Future Plans

This project will gradually evolve into a full Angular application.  
I'll begin integrating Angular as I progress in my learning, building components, services, and routing step by step.
